      </a>
      <p class="card-text">A simple way to measure obesity is the body mass index (BMI). It is calculated by dividing a
        person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. But don't worry, we do it for you. With this method
        we can classify if you are underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese, based exclusively on the individual's mass
        and height. It is not necessary to know your age, gender, body fat percentage or muscle mass. Just focus on staying healthy.
        Share your BMI results. Calculate your BMI with our special calculator. Easy to use and free!</p>

      </a>
      <p class="card-text">Generally we refer to "diet" as a synonym for a partial or near total deprivation of food.
        However, the correct meaning of Diet is the set of foods and dishes that are consumed every day, and constitutes the unit
        of food. A correct diet refers to eating habits that meet specific needs at different stages of life, promoting proper
        development and expected weight for height and preventing healthy development. From Quick Training we help you with your
        diet. Here are some tips to stay healthy based on your BMI and preferences.</p>

      </a>
      <p class="card-text">Proteins are found in every cell in the body. Our bodies need protein from the food we eat to
        build and maintain bones, muscles, and skin. It is important to get enough protein in the diet. You should eat protein
        every day, because the body doesn't store it the same way it stores fat or carbohydrates. This free protein calculator
        estimates the amount of protein a person needs each day to remain healthy based on certain averages and recommendations.</p>
